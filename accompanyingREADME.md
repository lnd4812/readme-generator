# README Generator

The purpose of this project is to create a command-line application using node JS that asks for answers to a series of questions using the Inquirer module from npm, pushes all of the answers to an array which is then "written", using fs.writeFile() to a template file using "module.exports that in turn generates a README file from answers that were input.
